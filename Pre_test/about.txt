This is an R-Project for the analysis of the 2017-2018 DESSA.
The data has been downloaded on November 20, 2018 from SNAP Webhost:
https://www.snapsurveys.com/  ~ "SEL Youth Assessment Fall 2018" data. The data is in *.csv format - convert it to excel for the inital analysis.

Structure of this project:
This set of R-Scripts computes the scores for the youth - for all the schools and generates two excel files with the results in  folder.
Star by running the R scripts in the following order:

A) For the DESSA computations:
Step 1: Recording the DESSA Item Raw Scores and treatment of the missing values
          R script: "1_DESSA_data_cleaning.R"
          R script: "1b_DESSA_missing_values.R"
          
Step 2: Calculating the DESSA Scale Raw Scores
          R script : "2_DESSA_Raw_scores.R

Step 3 (A): Determining DESSA T-Scores
          R script : "3_DESSA_T-Score.R"
Step 3 (B) : Determining DESSA Percentile Scores
          R script : "4_DESSA_Percentile-Score.R".
          
Step 4: Determining the T-Score and Percentile Score for the
        Social-Emotional Composite raw scores, T-Scores and Percentiles, and the descriptions.
          R script: "5_DESSA_Social_Emotional_Composite.R".
          R Script "5b_DESSA_descriptions.R" 
Step 5 : Merging the dataset from Prime Time Registry data to the survey.
          R Script : 6_Merging.R

B) For the results:
The R Scripts will generate two excel spreadsheets.
The result folder contains:

    •	“DESSA_Scoring.xlsx” (with all the  questions, raw scores and percentiles for the Personal Responsibility, 
                            Optimistic thinking, Goal-Directed Behavior, Social Awareness, Decision Making, 
                            Relationship Skills, Self-Awareness and Self-Management; and the Social Emotional Composite, 
                            raw scores, T-Scores and Percentiles).
                            
    •	“DESSA_Scoring_and_programs.xlsx” (This merged the DESSA Scores with the Practitioners ID and Program data)
